          <p>
            Hello all! Welcome to the rules for the
            ${version} Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Tournament. The simple part:
            Play on one of the <b>six</b> public servers (<a href="http://crawl.akrasiac.org">crawl.akrasiac.org</a>,
            <a href="http://crawl.beRotato.org">crawl.beRotato.org</a>,
            <a href="http://crawl.develz.org">crawl.develz.org</a>,
            <a href="http://kr.dobrazupa.org">kr.dobrazupa.org</a>,
            <a href="http://crawl.lantea.net:8080">crawl.lantea.net</a>,
            or <a href="http://crawl.s-z.org">crawl.s-z.org</a>)
            and all of
            your Crawl ${version} games that <b>start after <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140829T20">20:00 UTC on
            Aug 29</a></b> and <b>end before <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140914T20">20:00 UTC on Sept 14</a></b> will
            count toward the tournament.
          </p>

          <p>
            For players who participated in previous
            tournaments, please look at
            the <a href="#changes">Changes</a> section for a list of
            rule changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants in the tournament may form clans of six or
            fewer players. If you wish to be a member of a clan, you
            need to add a line to the top of one of your <b>version ${version}</b> rcfiles
            like this:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMCAPTAIN nameofcaptain</pre>

          <p>
            This should be the very first line of your rcfile, with no
            blank lines or comments appearing before this line. The #
            is important to make sure Crawl doesn't try to parse the
            team data as an option.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team captain must have the name of her team and the
            other team members in one of her <b>version ${version}</b> rcfiles, like this:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMNAME nameofteam
# TEAMMEMBERS player1 player2 player3 player4 player5</pre>

          <p>
            Again, these lines should be the very first two lines in
            the team captain's rcfile, with no blank lines or anything
            else appearing before these lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Note:</span> The team captain should <b>not</b>
            include a TEAMCAPTAIN line in her rcfile.
          </p>

          <div class="inset">
            <p>
              <span class="inline_heading">Note:</span> clan membership lines can be added to your ${version} rcfile on <b>any</b> of the public servers.
              If you add clan
              membership lines to more than one rcfile, then the rcfile on
              the server earliest in the list CBRO will take
              precedence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Clan names must contain only alphanumeric characters,
            underscores, and hyphens. Underscores will be converted into
            spaces. Once a player's username is in
            the captain's rcfile and the captain's username is in the
            player's rcfile and the tourney scripts notice this, the
            players will be in the same clan. The tourney scripts only check for
            updates to non-CSZO rcfiles once every four hours, so if
            you are impatient about this then you should edit your CSZO rcfile instead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clans may be changed by adding or removing players at any
            time until <b><a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140906T19">19:00 UTC on Sep 6</a></b>, after which clans will be
            effectively frozen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>A final note:</span> Please do not do anything that would give you an unfair competitive advantage over other players or teams. This includes things like running bots on your own account for speedrun points - just remember that the objective here is to have fun. (You are welcome to run bots on their own accounts in the tourney, though as always on online servers you should be careful not to hammer the CPU with them. Also, bot wins will not be displayed on lists of fastest wins.)
          </p>

            <h2>WINS</h2>
            <p>
              <span>100 points</span> for a player's first win. (Since winning
              is kind of the goal.)
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>50 points</span> for a player winning two characters of
              different species and backgrounds at some point during the tourney.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>60 extra points</span> for each consecutive (streak) win
              by a player with a species that has not 
	      previously been a streak win for that player.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>30 extra points</span> for each consecutive (streak) win
              by a player with a background that has not 
	      previously been a streak win for that player.
            </p>

            <div class="inset">
              <p>
                Every game in a streak must be the first game you start after
                winning the previous game in the streak. This
                will always be the case if you play all your games on
                one server.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're playing on multiple servers
                simultaneously, note that you cannot start game A and
                game B concurrently on two servers and win both in
                succession to earn streak points - you can however have
                multiple streaks in progress simultaneously.

            <h2>SPECIES/BACKGROUND/GOD WINS</h2>
            <p>
              <span>2*(52+T)/(2+S) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given species if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and S of those T were with the given species. If a player wins the same species multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus among the wins, not the sum.

              For example, if there have been 10 games won prior to the start of the win in question and 2 of them were with the same species, then the
              win will be worth 2*(52+10)/(2+2) = 31 additional points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(52+T)/(2+B) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given background if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and B of those T were with the given background. If a player wins the same background multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus, not the sum.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>1.5*(42+T)/(2+G) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given god if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and G of those T were with the given god. If a player wins with the same god multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus, not the sum. For purposes of these points we say that a player wins with a god if she reaches full (******) piety with that god without worshipping any other god first. For Xom, you must play a Chaos Knight and never abandon Xom. For "No God", you must never worship a god.

              <span>Qazlal</span> has a newly-added banner, the banner of <span><a href="#the_prophet">THE PROPHET</a></span>.

            </p>

            <p class="added">
              <span>Vehumet's <a href="#ruthless_efficiency">RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY</a></span> banner has been replaced; it now asks players to reach various milestones without the use of potions or scrolls. (It previously asked the player to get runes & wins within 27 real-life hours.) The third level of the banner is now worth 25 tournament points.
              <span class="added">[NEW]</span>
            </p>

            <p class="changed">
              <span>Makhleb's <a href="#speed_demons">SPEED DEMON</a></span> banner second and third tier have been revised; the second now asks the player to get a rune in 81 minutes (was previously 'reach the bottom of a rune branch in 27 minutes'), and the third now asks the player to win in 3 hours (previously 'get a rune in 27 minutes'). Formicids are now only forbidden from the first level of the banner (previously, also, the second).
